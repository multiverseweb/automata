# Automata

This repository contains implementations of various NFAs (Nondeterministic Finite Automata) and DFAs (Deterministic Finite Automata). These automata models are designed to solve specific problems in automata theory and can be executed using JFLAP, a widely used tool for visualizing and simulating automata.

## Features
- Collection of NFAs and DFAs for different scenarios.
- Readable and structured `.jff` files compatible with JFLAP.
- Useful for understanding and experimenting with automata concepts.

## Getting Started
- Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/multiverseweb/Automata-Collection.git
```

- Open the .jff files in JFLAP to simulate or edit the automata.

## Requirements
[JFLAP](https://www.jflap.org/jflaptmp/) installed on your system.
